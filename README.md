This is a custom fork of Storm for my Bachelor and Master Thesis at IIT Delhi, titled, "`INTERLEAVE` : An Empirically Faster Symbolic Algorithm for Maximal End Component Decomposition of MDPs" and advised by Suguman Bansal (Georgia Tech) and Subodh Sharma (IIT Delhi). Most of the code (except the new algorithm added -- `INTERLEAVE` and minor bug fixes) has been adapted from [the code for Felix Faber's Bachelor Thesis at RWTH Aachen](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8311805). I am grateful to Felix for writing an excellent thesis, and for writing code that was easy to understand and extend. Below is a brief description of the relevant files.

- `src/storm/storage/SymbolicMEC.h` and `src/storm/storage/SymbolicMEC_stats.h` contain the algorithm implementations (the `_stats` files additionally count the number of transition BDD operations)
- `src/storm/storage/SymbolicOperations.h` and `src/storm/storage/SymbolicOperations_stats.h` contain the implementations of symbolic operations (including a new implementation of `pick` which I tried out and added support for to the `src/storm/storage/dd`, `src/storm/storage/dd/cudd` and `src/storm/storage/dd/sylvan` folders)
- `src/storm/storage/SymbolicSCCDecomposition.h` and `src/storm/storage/SymbolicSCCDecomposition_stats.h` contain symbolic SCC decomposition algorithm implementations
- `src/storm/storage/THESIS_DEBUG.h` contains miscellaneous definitions of the algorithms we benchmarked.

To run any of the symbolic MEC decomposition algorithms, call the `storm` binary as usual, adding the argument `--benchmarkForceMECDecompositionAlgorithm <n>` with `n = 1,2,3` for `NAIVE, LOCKSTEP, INTERLEAVE`. Using `n = 4,5,6` also counts and outputs the number of symbolic operations performed by the `NAIVE, LOCKSTEP, INTERLEAVE` algorithms. Usual Storm GitHub README is below.

Usage
-----------------------------
The Storm website [www.stormchecker.org](https://www.stormchecker.org/) provides documentation and background information.
- For installation and usage instructions, check out the documentation found in [Getting Started](http://www.stormchecker.org/getting-started.html).
