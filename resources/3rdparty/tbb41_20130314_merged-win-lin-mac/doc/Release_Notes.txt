Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks - Release Notes
		  Version 4.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------


System Requirements
-------------------

Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks (Intel(R) TBB) is available
commercially (see http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-tbb) as a
binary distribution, and in open source, in both source and binary
forms (see http://threadingbuildingblocks.org).

When built from source, Intel(R) TBB is intended to be highly portable
and so supports a wide variety of operating systems and platforms (see
http://threadingbuildingblocks.org for more details).

Binary distributions, including commercial distributions, are validated
and officially supported for the hardware, software, operating systems
and compilers listed here.

	    or higher
	Intel(R) Xeon Phi(TM) coprocessor
    OS X* Systems
	Intel(R) Core(TM) 2 Duo processor or higher

Hardware - Supported

    Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 processor family and higher

Known Issues
------------

Please note the following with respect to this particular release of
Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks.

Library Issues

    - If an application is built for Microsoft* Windows* XP Professional
	or similar the _WIN32_WINNT macro must be set manually to 0x0501
	in order to limit the usage of modern API that is available on 
	newer operating systems.

    - If an application uses static version of MSVCRT libraries or uses
	Intel TBB DLL built with static MSVCRT (vc_mt variant), and throws
	an exception from a functor passed to task_group::run_and_wait(),
	the exception will not be intercepted by Intel TBB and will not result
	in cancellation of the task_group. For a workaround, catch the
	exception in the functor and explicitly cancel the task_group.

    - If an application uses debug version of Intel TBB DLL built with static 
	MSVCRT (vc_mt variant), Microsoft* Visual C++ debug library 10.0 
	(msvcp100d.dll) is required to be available on the system to run 
	an application.

    - If you are using Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks and OpenMP*
	constructs mixed together in rapid succession in the same
	program, and you are using Intel(R) compilers for your OpenMP*
	code, set KMP_BLOCKTIME to a small value (e.g., 20 milliseconds)
	to improve performance.  This setting can also be made within
	your OpenMP* code via the kmp_set_blocktime() library call.  See
	the Intel(R) compiler OpenMP* documentation for more details on
	KMP_BLOCKTIME and kmp_set_blocktime().

    - In general, non-debug ("release") builds of applications or
	examples should link against the non-debug versions of the
	Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks libraries, and debug builds
	should link against the debug versions of these libraries.  On
	Windows* OS, compile with /MD and use Intel(R) Threading
	Building Blocks release libraries, or compile with /MDd and use
	debug libraries; not doing so may cause run-time failures.  See
	the Tutorial in the product "doc" sub-directory for more details
	on debug vs. release libraries.
    
    - If open source verion installed to the system folders like /usr/lib64
	on Linux OS examples may fail to link because sometimes gcc
	searches for folders in the different order than expected.
	-L command line	linker option needs to be used to set the right
	location. This does not affect a program execution.
