  <div> 
	 <div class="section"> 
		<p>The scheduler employs a technique known as 
		  <em>work stealing</em>. Each thread keeps a "ready pool" of tasks that
		  are ready to run. The ready pool is structured as a deque (double-ended queue)
		  of task objects that were 
		  <em>spawned</em>. Additionally, there is a shared queue of 
		  <samp class="codeph">task</samp> objects that were 
		  <em>enqueued</em>. The distinction between spawning a task and enqueuing
		  a task affects when the scheduler runs the task. 
		</p>
 
		<p>After completing a task 
		  <samp class="codeph"><em>t</em></samp>, a thread chooses its next task according to
		  the first applicable rule below: 
		</p>
 
		<ol class="ol_3"> 
		  <li>The task returned by 
			 <samp class="codeph"><em>t</em>.execute()</samp> 
		  </li>
 
		  <li>The successor of 
			 <samp class="codeph"><em>t</em></samp> if 
			 <samp class="codeph"><em>t</em></samp> was its last completed predecessor. 
		  </li>
 
		  <li>A task popped from the end of the thread’s own deque. 
		  </li>
 
		  <li>A task with affinity for the thread. 
		  </li>
 
		  <li>A task popped from approximately the beginning of the shared queue.
			 
		  </li>
 
		  <li>A task popped from the beginning of another randomly chosen
			 thread’s deque. 
		  </li>
 
		</ol>
 
		<p>When a thread 
		  <samp class="codeph"><em>spawns</em></samp> a task, it pushes it onto the end of its
		  own deque. Hence rule (3) above gets the task most recently spawned by the
		  thread, whereas rule (6) gets the least recently spawned task of another
		  thread. 
		</p>
 
		<p>When a thread 
		  <em>enqueues</em> a task, it pushes it onto the end of the shared queue.
		  Hence rule (5) gets one of the less recently enqueued tasks, and has no
		  preference for tasks that are enqueued. This is in contrast to spawned tasks,
		  where by rule (3) a thread prefers its own most recently spawned task. 
		</p>
 
		<p>Note the “approximately” in rule (5). For scalability reasons, the
		  shared queue does 
		  <strong>not</strong> guarantee precise first-in first-out behavior. If strict
		  first-in first-out behavior is desired, put the real work in a separate queue,
		  and create tasks that pull work from that queue. The Non-Preemptive Priorities
		  section in the User Guide section explains the technique. 
		</p>
 
		<p>It is important to understand the implications of spawning versus
		  enqueuing for nested parallelism. 
		</p>
 
		<ul type="disc" class="ul_1"> 
		  <li class="li_1">Spawned tasks emphasize locality. Enqueued tasks
			 emphasize fairness. 
		  </li>
 
		</ul>
 
		<ul type="disc" class="ul_1"> 
		  <li class="li_1">For nested parallelism, spawned tasks tend
			 towards depth-first execution, whereas enqueued tasks cause breadth-first
			 execution. Because the space demands of breadth-first execution can be
			 exponentially higher than depth-first execution, enqueued tasks should be used
			 with care. 
		  </li>
 
		</ul>
 
		<ul type="disc" class="ul_1"> 
		  <li class="li_1">A spawned task might never be executed until a
			 thread explicitly waits on the task to complete. An enqueued tasks will
			 eventually run if all previously enqueued tasks complete. In the case where
			 there would ordinarily be no other worker thread to execute an enqueued task,
			 the scheduler creates an extra worker. 
		  </li>
 
		</ul>
 
		<p>In general, use spawned tasks unless there is a clear reason to use an
		  enqueued task. Spawned tasks yield the best balance between locality of
		  reference, space efficiency, and parallelism. The algorithm for spawned tasks
		  is similar to the work-stealing algorithm used by Cilk (Blumofe 1995). The
		  notion of work-stealing dates back to the 1980s (Burton 1981). The thread
		  affinity support is more recent (Acar 2000).
