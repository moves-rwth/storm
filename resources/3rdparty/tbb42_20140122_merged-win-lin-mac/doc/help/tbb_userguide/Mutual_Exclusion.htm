  <h1 class="topictitle1">Mutual Exclusion</h1>
 
   
  <div> 
	 <p>Mutual exclusion controls how many threads can simultaneously run a
		region of code. In Intel&reg; Threading Building Blocks (Intel&reg; TBB), mutual
		exclusion is implemented by 
		<em>mutexes</em> and 
		<em>locks.</em> A mutex is an object on which a thread can acquire a lock.
		Only one thread at a time can have a lock on a mutex; other threads have to
		wait their turn. 
	 </p>
 
	 <p>The simplest mutex is 
		<samp class="codeph">spin_mutex</samp>. A thread trying to acquire a lock on a 
		<samp class="codeph">spin_mutex</samp> busy waits until it can acquire the lock. A 
		<samp class="codeph">spin_mutex</samp> is appropriate when the lock is held for only
		a few instructions. For example, the following code uses a mutex 
		<samp class="codeph">FreeListMutex</samp> to protect a shared variable 
		<samp class="codeph">FreeList</samp>. It checks that only a single thread has access
		to 
		<samp class="codeph">FreeList</samp> at a time. The black font shows the usual
		sequential code. Insertions added to make the code thread-safe, are shown in 
		<samp class="codeph"><span style="color:blue"><strong>bold font</strong></span></samp>. 
	 </p>
 
	 <pre>Node* FreeList;
<span style="color:blue"><strong>typedef spin_mutex FreeListMutexType;</strong></span>
<span style="color:blue"><strong>FreeListMutexType FreeListMutex;</strong></span>
&nbsp;
Node* AllocateNode() {
    Node* n;
    <span style="color:blue"><strong>{</strong></span>
        <span style="color:blue"><strong>FreeListMutexType::scoped_lock lock(FreeListMutex);</strong></span>
        n = FreeList;
        if( n )
            FreeList = n-&gt;next;
    <span style="color:blue"><strong>}</strong></span>
    if( !n ) 
        n = new Node();
    return n;
}
&nbsp;
void FreeNode( Node* n ) {
    <span style="color:blue"><strong>FreeListMutexType::scoped_lock lock(FreeListMutex);</strong></span>
    n-&gt;next = FreeList;
    FreeList = n;
}</pre> 
	 <p>The constructor for 
		<samp class="codeph">scoped_lock</samp> waits until there are no other locks on 
		<samp class="codeph">FreeListMutex</samp>. The destructor releases the lock. The
		braces inside routine 
		<samp class="codeph">AllocateNode</samp> may look unusual. Their role is to keep the
		lifetime of the lock as short as possible, so that other waiting threads can
		get their chance as soon as possible. 
	 </p>
 
	 <div class="Note"><h3 class="NoteTipHead">
					Caution</h3> 
		<p>Be sure to name the lock object, otherwise it will be destroyed too
		  soon. For example, if the creation of the 
		  <samp class="codeph">scoped_lock</samp> object in the example is changed to 
		</p>
 
		<pre>FreeListMutexType::scoped_lock (FreeListMutex);</pre> 
		<p>then the 
		  <samp class="codeph">scoped_lock</samp> is destroyed when execution reaches the
		  semicolon, which releases the lock 
		  <em>before</em> 
		  <samp class="codeph">FreeList</samp> is accessed. 
		</p>
 
	 </div> 
	 <p>The following shows an alternative way to write 
		<samp class="codeph">AllocateNode</samp>: 
	 </p>
 
	 <pre>Node* AllocateNode() {
    Node* n;
    FreeListMutexType::scoped_lock lock;
    lock.acquire(FreeListMutex);
    n = FreeList;
    if( n )
        FreeList = n-&gt;next;
    lock.release();
    if( !n ) 
        n = new Node();
    return n;
}</pre> 
	 <p>Method 
		<samp class="codeph">acquire</samp> waits until it can acquire a lock on the mutex;
		method 
		<samp class="codeph">release</samp> releases the lock. 
	 </p>
 
	 <p>It is recommended that you add extra braces where possible, to clarify
		to maintainers which code is protected by the lock. 
	 </p>
 
	 <p>If you are familiar with C interfaces for locks, you may be wondering
		why there are not simply acquire and release methods on the mutex object
		itself. The reason is that the C interface would not be exception safe, because
		if the protected region threw an exception, control would skip over the
		release. With the object-oriented interface, destruction of the 
		<samp class="codeph">scoped_lock</samp> object causes the lock to be released, no
		matter whether the protected region was exited by normal control flow or an
		exception. This is true even for our version of 
		<samp class="codeph">AllocateNode</samp> that used methods 
		<samp class="codeph">acquire</samp> and 
		<samp class="codeph">release –</samp> the explicit release causes the lock to be
		released earlier, and the destructor then sees that the lock was released and
		does nothing. 
	 </p>
 
	 <p>All mutexes in Intel&reg; TBB have a similar interface, which not only makes
		them easier to learn, but enables generic programming. For example, all of the
		mutexes have a nested 
		<samp class="codeph">scoped_lock</samp> type, so given a mutex of type 
		<samp class="codeph"><var>M</var></samp>, the corresponding lock type is 
		<samp class="codeph"><var>M</var>::scoped_lock</samp>. 
	 </p>
 
	 <div class="Note"><h3 class="NoteTipHead">
					Tip</h3> 
		<p>It is recommended that you always use a 
		  <samp class="codeph">typedef</samp> for the mutex type, as shown in the previous
		  examples. That way, you can change the type of the lock later without having to
		  edit the rest of the code. In the examples, you could replace the 
		  <samp class="codeph">typedef</samp> with 
		  <samp class="codeph">typedef queuing_mutex FreeListMutexType</samp>, and the code
		  would still be correct.
