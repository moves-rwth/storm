  <div> 
	 <p>Method 
		<samp class="codeph">spawn_and_wait_for_all</samp> enables an executing parent task
		to wait until its child tasks complete, but can incur some inefficiency. When a
		thread calls 
		<samp class="codeph">spawn_and_wait_for_all</samp>, it keeps busy until all of the
		childen complete by working on other tasks. Sometimes the parent task becomes
		ready to continue, but cannot do so immediately because its thread is still
		executing one of the other tasks. The solution is for the parent to not wait on
		its children, and instead spawn both children and return. The children are
		allocated not as children of the parent, but as children of the parent’s 
		<em>continuation task</em>. Any idle thread can steal and run the
		continuation task when its children complete.

	 <p>The following differences between the original version and the
		continuation version need to be understood: 
	 </p>
 
	 <p>The big difference is that in the original version 
		<samp class="codeph">x</samp> and 
		<samp class="codeph">y</samp> were local variables in method 
		<samp class="codeph">execute</samp>. In the continuation-passing version, they
		cannot be local variables, because the parent returns before its children
		complete. Instead, they are fields of the continuation task 
		<samp class="codeph">FibContinuation.</samp> 
	 </p>
 
	 <p>The allocation logic is changed. The continuation is allocated with 
		<samp class="codeph">allocate_continuation</samp>. It is similar to 
		<samp class="codeph">allocate_child</samp>, except that it forwards the 
		<em>successor</em> of 
		<samp class="codeph">this</samp> to 
		<samp class="codeph">c</samp>, and sets the 
		<em>successor</em> of 
		<samp class="codeph">this</samp> to NULL. The following figure summarizes the
		transformation: 
	 </p>
 
	 <div class="fignone" id="fig9"><a name="fig9"><!-- --></a><span class="figcap">Action of 
		  <samp class="codeph">allocate_continuation</samp></span> 
		<br><img src="Images/image016.jpg" width="432" height="128"><br> 
	 </div>
 
	 <p>A property of the transformation is that it does not change the
		reference count of the successor, and thus avoids interfering with
		reference-counting logic. 
	 </p>
 
	 <p>The reference count is set to 
		<samp class="codeph">2</samp>, the number of children. In the original version, it
		was set to 
		<samp class="codeph">3</samp> because 
		<samp class="codeph">spawn_and_wait_for_all</samp> required the augmented count.
		Furthermore, the code sets the reference count of the continuation instead of
		the parent, because it is the execution of the continuation that waits on the
		children. 
	 </p>
 
	 <p>The pointer 
		<samp class="codeph">sum</samp> is passed to the continuation by the constructor,
		because it is now 
		<samp class="codeph">FibContinuation</samp> that stores into 
		<samp class="codeph">*sum</samp>. The children are still allocated with 
		<samp class="codeph">allocate_child</samp>, but notice that now they are allocated
		as children of the continuation 
		<samp class="codeph">c</samp>, not the parent. This is so that 
		<samp class="codeph">c</samp>, and not 
		<samp class="codeph">this</samp>, becomes the successor of the children that is
		automatically spawned when both children complete. If you accidentally used 
		<samp class="codeph">this.allocate_child()</samp>, then the parent task would run
		again after both children completed. 
	 </p>
 
	 <p>If you remember how the original top-level code, 
		<samp class="codeph">ParallelFib</samp>, was written, you might be worried now that
		continuation-passing style breaks the code, because now the root 
		<samp class="codeph">FibTask</samp> completes before the children are done, and the
		top-level code used 
		<samp class="codeph">spawn_root_and_wait</samp> to wait on the root 
		<samp class="codeph">FibTask</samp>. This is not a problem, because 
		<samp class="codeph">spawn_root_and_wait</samp> is designed to work correctly with
		continuation-passing style. An invocation 
		<samp class="codeph">spawn_root_and_wait(<var>x</var>)</samp> does not
		actually wait for 
		<var>x</var> to complete. Instead, it constructs a dummy
		successor of 
		<var>x</var>, and waits for the successors’s reference count to
		be decremented. Because 
		<samp class="codeph">allocate_continuation</samp> forwards this dummy successor to
		the continuation, the dummy successor’s reference count is not decremented
		until the continuation completes.
