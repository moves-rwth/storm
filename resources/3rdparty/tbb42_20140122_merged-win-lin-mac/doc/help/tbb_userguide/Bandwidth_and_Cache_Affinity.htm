  <div> 
	 <p>For a sufficiently simple function 
		<samp class="codeph">Foo</samp>, the examples might not show good speedup when
		written as parallel loops. The cause could be insufficient system bandwidth
		between the processors and memory. In that case, you may have to rethink your
		algorithm to take better advantage of cache. Restructuring to better utilize
		the cache usually benefits the parallel program as well as the serial program. 
	 </p>
 
	 <p>An alternative to restructuring that works in some cases is 
		<samp class="codeph">affinity_partitioner.</samp> It not only automatically chooses
		the grainsize, but also optimizes for cache affinity. Using 
		<samp class="codeph">affinity_partitioner</samp> can significantly improve
		performance when: 
	 </p>
 
	 <ul type="disc"> 
		<li> 
		  <p>The computation does a few operations per data access. 
		  </p>
 
		</li>
 
		<li> 
		  <p>The data acted upon by the loop fits in cache. 
		  </p>
 
		</li>
 
		<li> 
		  <p>The loop, or a similar loop, is re-executed over the same data. 
		  </p>
 
		</li>
 
		<li> 
		  <p>There are more than two hardware threads available. If only two
			 threads are available, the default scheduling in Intel&reg; Threading Building
			 Blocks (Intel&reg; TBB) usually provides sufficient cache affinity. 
		  </p>
 
		</li>
 
	 </ul>
 
	 <p>The following code shows how to use 
		<samp class="codeph">affinity_partitioner</samp>. 
	 </p>
 
	 <pre>#include "tbb/tbb.h"
&nbsp;
void ParallelApplyFoo( float a[], size_t n ) {
    static affinity_partitioner ap;
    parallel_for(blocked_range&lt;size_t&gt;(0,n), ApplyFoo(a), ap);
}
&nbsp;
void TimeStepFoo( float a[], size_t n, int steps ) {    
    for( int t=0; t&lt;steps; ++t )
        ParallelApplyFoo( a, n );
}</pre> 
	 <p>In the example, the 
		<samp class="codeph">affinity_partitioner</samp> object 
		<samp class="codeph">ap</samp> lives between loop iterations. It remembers where
		iterations of the loop ran, so that each iteration can be handed to the same
		thread that executed it before. The example code gets the lifetime of the
		partitioner right by declaring the 
		<samp class="codeph">affinity_partitioner</samp> as a local static object. Another
		approach would be to declare it at a scope outside the iterative loop in 
		<samp class="codeph">TimeStepFoo</samp>, and hand it down the call chain to 
		<samp class="codeph">parallel_for</samp>. 
	 </p>
 
	 <p>If the data does not fit across the system’s caches, there may be little
		benefit. The following figure shows the situations. 
	 </p>
 
	 <div class="fignone" id="fig3"><a name="fig3"><!-- --></a><span class="figcap">Benefit of Affinity Determined by Relative Size of Data Set and
		  Cache</span> 
		<br><img src="Images/image007.jpg" width="453" height="178"><br> 
	 </div>
 
	 <p>The next figure shows how parallel speedup might vary with the size of a
		data set. The computation for the example is 
		<samp class="codeph">A[i]+=B[i]</samp> for 
		<samp class="codeph">i</samp> in the range [0,N). It was chosen for dramatic effect.
		You are unlikely to see quite this much variation in your code. The graph shows
		not much improvement at the extremes. For small N, parallel scheduling overhead
		dominates, resulting in little speedup. For large N, the data set is too large
		to be carried in cache between loop invocations. The peak in the middle is the
		sweet spot for affinity. Hence 
		<samp class="codeph">affinity_partitioner</samp> should be considered a tool, not a
		cure-all, when there is a low ratio of computations to memory accesses.
