  <div> 
	 <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Problem</h2> 
		 
		<p>Parallelism is so fine grained that overhead of parallel scheduling or
		  communication swamps the useful work. 
		</p>
 
	 </div>
 
	 <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Context</h2> 
		 
		<p>Many algorithms permit parallelism at a very fine grain, on the order
		  of a few instructions per task. But synchronization between threads usually
		  requires orders of magnitude more cycles. For example, elementwise addition of
		  two arrays can be done fully in parallel, but if each scalar addition is
		  scheduled as a separate task, most of the time will be spent doing
		  synchronization instead of useful addition. 
		</p>
 
	 </div>
 
	 <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Forces</h2> 
		 
		<ul type="disc"> 
		  <li> 
			 <p>Individual computations can be done in parallel, but are small.
				For practical use of Intel&reg; Threading Building Blocks (Intel&reg; TBB),
				"small" here means less than 10,000 clock cycles. 
			 </p>
 
		  </li>
 
		  <li> 
			 <p>The parallelism is for sake of performance and not required for
				semantic reasons. 
			 </p>
 
		  </li>
 
		</ul>
 
	 </div>
 
	 <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Solution</h2> 
		 
		<p>Group the computations into blocks. Evaluate computations within a
		  block serially. 
		</p>
 
		<p>The block size should be chosen to be large enough to amortize
		  parallel overhead. Too large a block size may limit parallelism or load
		  balancing because the number of blocks becomes too small to distribute work
		  evenly across processors. 
		</p>
 
		<p>The choice of block topology is typically driven by two concerns: 
		</p>
 
		<ul type="disc"> 
		  <li> 
			 <p>Minimizing synchronization between blocks. 
			 </p>
 
		  </li>
 
		  <li> 
			 <p>Minimizing cache traffic between blocks. 
			 </p>
 
		  </li>
 
		</ul>
 
		<p>If the computations are completely independent, then the blocks will
		  be independent too, and then only cache traffic issues must be considered. 
		</p>
 
		<p>If the loop is "small", on the order of less than 10,000 clock cycles,
		  then it may be impractical to parallelize at all, because the optimal
		  agglomeration might be a single block, 
		</p>
 
	 </div>
 
	 <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Examples</h2> 
		 
		<p>Intel&reg; TBB loop templates such as 
		  <samp class="codeph">tbb::parallel_for</samp> that take a 
		  <em>range</em> argument support automatic agglomeration. 
		</p>
 
		<p>When agglomerating, think about cache effects. Avoid having cache
		  lines cross between groups if possible. 
		</p>
 
		<p>There may be boundary to interior ratio effects. For example, if the
		  computations form a 2D grid, and communicate only with nearest neighbors, then
		  the computation per block grows quadratically (with the block’s area), but the
		  cross-block communication grows with linearly (with the block’s perimeter). The
		  following figure shows four different ways to agglomerate an 8×8 grid. If doing
		  such analysis, be careful to consider that information is transferred in cache
		  line units. For a given area, the perimeter may be minimized when the block is
		  square with respect to the underlying grid of cache lines, not square with
		  respect to the logical grid. 
		</p>

		  <img width="301" height="293" src="Images/image002.jpg"> 
		</div>
 
		<p>Also consider vectorization. Blocks that contain long contiguous
		  subsets of data may better enable vectorization. 
		</p>
 
		<p>For recursive computations, most of the work is towards the leaves, so
		  the solution is to treat subtrees as a groups as shown in the following figure.
		  
		</p>

		  <img width="291" height="150" src="Images/image003.jpg"> 
		</div>
 
		<p>Often such an agglomeration is achieved by recursing serially once
		  some threshold is reached. For example, a recursive sort might solve
		  sub-problems in parallel only if they are above a certain threshold size. 
		</p>

		<p>Ian Foster introduced the term "agglomeration" in his book 
		  <cite>Designing and Building Parallel Programs</cite>
		  http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~itf/dbpp. There agglomeration is part of a four step 
		  <strong>PCAM</strong> design method: 
		</p>
 
		<ol> 
		  <li> 
			 <p><strong>P</strong>artitioning - break the program into the smallest tasks
				possible. 
			 </p>
 
		  </li>
 
		  <li> 
			 <p><strong>C</strong>ommunication – figure out what communication is required
				between tasks. When using Intel&reg; TBB, communication is usually cache line
				transfers. Though they are automatic, understanding which ones happen between
				tasks helps guide the agglomeration step. 
			 </p>
 
		  </li>
 
		  <li> 
			 <p><strong>A</strong>gglomeration – combine tasks into larger tasks. His book
				has an extensive list of considerations that is worth reading. 
			 </p>
 
		  </li>
 
		  <li> 
			 <p><strong>M</strong>apping – map tasks onto processors. The Intel&reg; TBB task
				scheduler does this step for you. 
			 </p>
 
		  </li>
 
		</ol>
