pantheios - FAQ
===============

Updated:    27th December 2010



The FAQ list is under (constant) development. If you post a question on the
Tutorials forum (https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=647484)
it will be used to create one.

FAQs:
=====

Q1: "What happens if the Pantheios libraries fail to
  initialise?"   [2nd October 2006]

A1:
  The process will be terminated, via exit() (ExitProcess() on Windows)

  From 1.0.1 beta 4 onwards, library initialisation is also accompanied
  by invocation of pantheios_onBailOut(), a fallback log function that is
  used by the Core (and Front/Back-end(s)) to report on a failure to
  initialise Pantheios. The output facilities are operating
  system-dependent:
    * on UNIX the bail-out message is written to syslog() and to
      the console of the calling process (via fprintf()), and to
      a local file "logging-bailout.txt" (appending if already
      exists)
    * on Windows the bail-out message is written to the debugger
      (via OutputDebugString()), the console (if any) of the
      calling process (via WriteFile()), to a local file
      "logging-bailout.txt" (appending if already exists), and to
      the Windows Event Log (under the source "logging-bailout").

      Note: The Event Log messages will not be correctly formatted
      (although their information will be accessible), unless
      pantheios.COM is installed: The Windows bail-out
      functionality piggy backs on the Event Log message resources
      in pantheios.COM (version 1.0.1 beta 3 or later).


Q2: "What if I need more than 32 parameters?"

A2:
  You can regenerate the six automatically-generated files as follows:
    - edit the scripts/make_hdrs.rb (Ruby) script
    - change the NUM_PARAMS constant to the required value
    - run the script from the scripts directory. You may have to change
      file permissions of the automatically-generated files, if they're
      read-only


Q3: "How do I represent a process Id?"   [15th November 2007]

A3:
  By using the pantheios::processId inserter.

  #include <pantheios/inserters/ids.hpp>

  int main()
  {
    pantheios::log_NOTICE("process id=", pantheios::processId);
  }


Q4: "What is 'Pure Pantheios'?"   [15th November 2007]

A4:
  Pantheios is primarily a logging _API_ library. That is, it is explictly
  designed to layer over the top of other, feature-rich, logging libraries.
  Of course, it comes with several of its own transport mechanisms, known as
  back-ends, but they are not part of 'Pure Pantheios'.

  Technically speaking, 'Pure Pantheios' consists only of:

  - The Application Layer
  - The Core

  The Application Layer talks only to the Core. The Core talks to a
  Front-End and a Back-End, which are, strictly, external to
  'Pure Pantheios'.

  The Core talks to the Front-End via the following four functions, declared
  in include/pantheios/frontend.h:

  - pantheios_fe_init()
      initialises the front-end; called at most once per process
  - pantheios_fe_uninit()
      uninitialises the front-end; called at most once per process
  - pantheios_fe_getProcessIdentity()
      returns a C-style string that names the current process, e.g.
      "logdaemon"; called at most once per process
  - pantheios_fe_isSeverityLogged()
      returns an integer to indicate whether a log statement of a given
      severity level is to be emitted to the Back-End; called each time
      a statement is processed

  These functions must be implemented by any Front-End linked to the
  application/shared object.

  The Core talks to the Back-End via the following three functions, declared
  in include/pantheios/backend.h:

  - pantheios_be_init()
      initialises the back-end; called at most once per process
  - pantheios_be_uninit()
      uninitialises the back-end; called at most once per process
  - pantheios_be_logEntry()
      called to emit each statement

  These functions must be implemented by any Back-End linked to the
  application/shared object.

  Pantheios comes with a number of stock Front-End and Back-end libraries,
  for the convenience of users. Furthermore, a number of Inserter Classes
  are provided which supplement the Application Layer, including:

  - pantheios::integer      - inserts an integer argument
  - pantheios::real
  - pantheios::pointer
  - pantheios::character
  - pantheios::args
  - pantheios::blob
  - pantheios::b64
  - pantheios::processId
  - pantheios::threadId

  Importantly, instances of these Inserters do not perform any conversions
  (or allocate memory) unless the given statement they are in is to be
  emitted (as determined by pantheios_fe_isSeverityLogged()). This is one of
  many ways in which Pantheios provides extremely high-levels of
  performance.


Q5: "Is Pantheios thread-safe?"   [19th November 2007]

A5:
  The short answer is: Yes.

  The long answer is:

  The Core is thread-safe. The Core initialisation/uninitialisation
  functions are reference-counted. On architectures with atomic integer
  operations *all* calls to pantheios_init() are thread-safe. On other
  architectures *all* calls to pantheios_init() except the first are
  thread-safe.

  The Application is layer is thread-safe simply because there is no
  shared state between threads in any application layer components.

  As for the Front-end and Back-ends, the answer is: It depends.

  The Front-end functions pantheios_fe_init(), pantheios_fe_uninit() and
  pantheios_fe_getProcessIdentity() are called at most once per-process
  during the initialisation phase. Therefore, they do not need to be
  thread-safe. The Front-end function pantheios_fe_isSeverityLogged() is
  called every time a statement is processed, to evaluate whether the
  statement should be emitted to the back-end(s). Thus, this function
  must be thread-safe.

  The Back-end functions pantheios_be_init(), and pantheios_be_uninit()
  are called at most once per-process during the initialisation phase.
  Therefore, they do not need to be thread-safe. The Back-end function
  pantheios_be_logEntry() is called every time a statement is to be
  emitted. It must be thread-safe.

  All stock Front-end and Back-end implementations are thread-safe.

  If you write custom Front-end and/or Back-end, you must ensure that
  the functions pantheios_fe_isSeverityLogged() and pantheios_be_logEntry()
  are thread-safe. If you do so, your use of Pantheios will be entirely
  thread-safe.


Q6: "How do I alter the number of parameters in the Application Layer?"   [25th November 2007]

A6:
  There are two ways.

  First, if you wish to reduce the number of parameters in the Application
  Layer - presumably to speed compilation when you don't need the full
  range of parameters - then you can simply #define the pre-processor
  symbol PANTHEIOS_APPL_PARAMS_LIMIT (introduced in 1.0.1 beta 60) to a
  number between 1 and 32.

  Second, if you wish to increase the number of parameters available in
  functions in the N-ary Function Templates of the Application Layer, you
  must re-generate the Application Layer headers using the make_hdrs.rb
  Ruby script in the script directory. However, we would advise that if
  you are writing application code that needs to pass more than 32
  parameters to Pantheios, you are unlikely to be writing transparent
  code, one of the design requirements of Pantheios.


Q7: "Why do the back-end(s) have to be specified at link-time?"   [3rd January 2008]

A7:
 The short answer is: Because Pantheios is initialised automatically,
  and before main() is called. (This is actually done by using the Schwarz
  counters found in include/pantheios/internal/initialiser.hpp, included by
  include/pantheios/pantheios.hpp unless in a DLL context or you #define
  PANTHEIOS_NO_AUTO_INIT)

  This is done to allow any piece of code in any part of the system to be
  able to log any conditions that may be necessary. If the process could not
  log before main() started, this might not be possible; indeed, how would
  you log a failure in another pre-main sub-system?

  The reason why this question comes up a lot is, of course, because users
  quite reasonably want to be able to specify logging options, at the start
  of main().

  The best approach to cater for both requirements is as follows:
   1. Link to be.N
   2. Define the PAN_BE_N_BACKEND_LIST array (see the documentation on be.N)
      for an explanation of how this works. Make sure to include an entry
      for a back-end that does not need any configuration, e.g. be.syslog.
      Then also include an entry for a back-end that provides run-time
      customisation, say, be.YourConfigurableBackEnd.
   3. Customise be.YourConfigurableBackEnd inside main(). If the program
      does not make it as far as main(), at least you will have had some
      logging output go to Syslog, via be.syslog.

  NOTE: A future version of Pantheios will include be.loader, which will
  allow you to load and configure back-ends at runtime, based on
  configuration file(s)


Q8: "I get linker errors with GCC, even though I'm specifying the core,
     front-end and back-end libraries. I've used nm, and the core library
     says it contains the missing symbols. What gives?"   [28th January 2008]

A8:
  What's going on here is that GCC's linker reads symbols in a
  left-to-right manner. The Pantheios initialisation functions -
  pantheios_init(), pantheios_uninit() - must be elicited from the core
  library, which is listed first in the libraries list. They then require
  symbols from the back-end and front-end libraries, which come next in
  the libraries list. They, in turn, require symbols from the core, which
  must therefore be listed again, at the end of the libraries list. The
  GCC makefiles included in the distribution do this, and can be used as
  templates for how to do it in your own projects.


Q9: "Does Pantheios provide a configuration that yields a logged message
     containing the containing function, equivalent to:

       log(informational, __FUNCTION__, ": my message");

     without having to write that (or some wrapper that checks for compiler
     support)."   [15th March 2008]

A9:
  You need to #define PANTHEIOS_TRACE_PREFIX to what you want. By default
  it is '__FILE__ "(" PANTHEIOS_STRINGIZE(__LINE__) "): "', which gives the
  format '<file>(<line>): '

  To include the function, lets says you want it to have the format
  '<file>(<line>): <func>: '. To achieve this you'd define it as follows:

    #include <pantheios/pantheios.h>
    #define PANTHEIOS_TRACE_PREFIX         __FILE__ " " PANTHEIOS_STRINGIZE(__LINE__) ": " __FUNCTION__ ": "
    #include <pantheios/trace.h>

  Note that the definition *must* come before the inclusion of
  pantheios/trace.h. Therefore, a safer way of doing this is as follows:

    /* File: myPantheiosRootHeader.h */
    #include <pantheios/pantheios.h>

    #ifdef PANTHEIOS_INCL_PANTHEIOS_H_TRACE
    # error pantheios/trace.h must not be included before myPantheiosRootHeader.h
    #endif /* PANTHEIOS_INCL_PANTHEIOS_H_TRACE */

    #define PANTHEIOS_TRACE_PREFIX         __FILE__ " " PANTHEIOS_STRINGIZE(__LINE__) ": " __FUNCTION__ ": "
    #include <pantheios/trace.h>


Q10: "Do you hand code the makefiles?"   [18th June 2008]

A10:
  No, although it sometimes feels a bit like that. I use a proprietary
  tool, tmpl2make, that takes a makefile template and a tools
  configuration file, and runs a merge over them. The makefile template
  language has IFDEF and FOREACH, but it's still a non-trivial effort to
  start a new one, which is why I tend to copy them from established
  projects (such as Pantheios) to new ones (flecxx, FastFormat).


Q11: "Have you considered CMake?"   [18th June 2008]

A11:
  Yes, and it's on the roadmap for post 1.0 things to do (along with
  project/solution files for XCode, Code::Blocks(), and so on). However,
  it will always be the case that the raw makefiles will be available for
  maximum portability.


Q12: "Which compilers support implicit linking with Pantheios?"   [16th October 2008]

A12:
  Borland, Metrowerks CodeWarrior (on Windows), Intel (on Windows) and
  Visual C++.


Q13: "How do I link when using compilers that don't support implicit linking?"   [16th October 2008]

A13:
  You must use explicit linking.

  For example, say you're using GCC on UNIX, and wishing to use the
  fe.simple front-end and along with the be.fprintf back-end. The
  libraries you link to depend on the configuration.

  For single-threaded & debug, you need to link to:

   pantheios.1.core.gcc40.debug.a
   pantheios.1.util.gcc40.debug.a
   pantheios.1.fe.simple.gcc40.debug.a
   pantheios.1.be.fprintf.gcc40.debug.a
   pantheios.1.bec.fprintf.gcc40.debug.a

  The command-line will look like:

   g++ -Dunix -I$PANTHEIOS_ROOT/include -I$STLSOFT/include \
     -L$PANTHEIOS_ROOT/lib \
     -lpantheios.1.core.gcc40 \
     -lpantheios.1.fe.simple.gcc40 \
     -lpantheios.1.be.fprintf.gcc40 \
     -lpantheios.1.bec.fprintf.gcc40 \
     -lpantheios.1.core.gcc40 \
     -lpantheios.1.util.gcc40 \
     my_program.cpp

  Note the double specification of the pantheios.1.core.gcc40.debug.a
  library. This is required with GCC because of the way it handles
  library lookup and interpositioning: basically the core depends on
  symbols defined in the front-end and back-end(s), and they in turn
  depend on some symbols defined in the core, so it has to be specified
  before and after them


Q14: "I'm using the Trace API, but it fails to print the function. Why?" [6th May 2009]

A14:
  You are using a compiler that does not support the __FUNCTION__ macro. At
  the current time (Pantheios 1.0.1-beta 186, STLSoft 1.9.81), the compilers
  known to support it are:

    * Comeau
    * Digital Mars (8.50+)
    * GCC (3+)
    * Intel C/C++ (7+)
    * Metrowerks CodeWarrior (8+)
    * Visual C++ (7.0+)
    * Watcom C/C++ (OpenWatcom 1.4+)
    * SunPro 5.9 (by defining __FUNCTION__ in terms of the compiler-specific
       __func__)

  Those known to not support it are:

    * Borland (all versions 5.5 - 6.1)
    * VectorC

  If your compiler does not support it, then the only avenue available if
  you absolutely must have it, is to #define it in each function, as in:

    int main()
    {
    #define __FUNCTION__ main

      PANTHEIOS_TRACE_PRINTF(pantheios::notice, "a string '%s' and a number %d", "<abc>", 42);

      . . .

  You'll also need to "persuade" the trace macro you wish to use that it can
  actually proceed. In the example.cpp.tracing.with_function example, the
  PANTHEIOS_TRACE_PREFIX macro is defined as follows:

    // From examples/cpp/example.cpp.tracing.with_function/example.cpp.tracing.with_function.cpp

    #ifdef STLSOFT_CF_FUNCTION_SYMBOL_SUPPORT
    # define PANTHEIOS_TRACE_PREFIX             __FILE__ " " PANTHEIOS_STRINGIZE(__LINE__) ": " __FUNCTION__ ": "
    #endif /* STLSOFT_CF_FUNCTION_SYMBOL_SUPPORT */

  If you're using a compiler that does not support __FUNCTION__, and for
  which STLSOFT_CF_FUNCTION_SYMBOL_SUPPORT is not defined, you would remove
  the #ifdef and #endif lines.

  If you wish to ensure that program remains compatible with compilers that
  do support __FUNCTION__, then you would add a guard around the #define, as
  in:

    int main()
    {
    #ifndef STLSOFT_CF_FUNCTION_SYMBOL_SUPPORT
    # define __FUNCTION__ "main"
    #endif /* !STLSOFT_CF_FUNCTION_SYMBOL_SUPPORT */

    . . .


Q15: "I have numerous back ends defined, and am trying to pass the
  log message to a specific backend for a specific log level, like this:

    log_message( int logLevel, int log_BE, const char* message)
    {
      pantheios::log(pantheios::critical(log_BE), "log this");
    }

  but change pantheios::critical() to be based on the logLevel, such as
  PANTHEIOS_SEV_DEBUG or similar. How is this done?"   [21st May 2009]

A15:
  Use PANTHEIOS_MAKE_EXTENDED_SEVERITY() to define severity+extended_info
  on the fly, as in:

    // C example
    pantheios_logprintf(
      PANTHEIOS_MAKE_EXTENDED_SEVERITY(PANTHEIOS_SEV_NOTICE, 10), "hello");

  and:

    // C++ example
    pantheios::log(
      PANTHEIOS_MAKE_EXTENDED_SEVERITY(PANTHEIOS_SEV_NOTICE, 10), "hello");

  You can #define your own codebase-specific macro that's more
  succinct, e.g:

    #define ACME_SEV_X(sev, x) PANTHEIOS_MAKE_EXTENDED_SEVERITY(sev, x)

  and use it as:

    log_message( int logLevel, int log_BE, const char* message)
    {
      pantheios::log(ACME_SEV_X(logLevel, log_BE), "log this");
    }


Q16: "Currently the logging format is something like: 

    [Project.5844, 5/20/2009 1:58:37.006 PM; Debug ]: logging message 
 
  Is there any way to modify the format of this?"   [21st May 2009]

A16:
  Yes, in a limited way, via the callback mechanism. Link to a callback
  version of a particular back-end library and implement the back-end
  callback initialisation function.
  
  This allows you to turn on/off various format prefix fields

    [process identity, thread identity, date, time, severity, etc.]

  For example, the non-callback version of the be.fprintf back-end is
  defined in the bec.fprintf library (e.g.
  pantheios.1.bec.fprintf.vc9.lib), whereas the callback version is defined
  in the bec.fprintf.WithCallback library (e.g.
  pantheios.1.bec.fprintf.WithCallback.vc6.lib).
  
  The callback initialisation function for be.fprintf is 
  pantheios_be_fprintf_getAppInit(). You implement this function and
  customise the behaviour of be.fprintf via the flags member of
  pan_be_fprintf_init_t.
    
  Note that the only reordering possible is to put the whole prefix,
  en-bloc, to the end (as a suffix). For more sophisticated ordering, the
  only option currently available is to write your own back-end, or engage
  the services of Synesis Software (http://www.synesis.com.au/contact.html)
  to assist you.


Q17: "I'm going through and converting a lot of printf statements to
  pantheios::log statements and I'm unsure of how to best retain the pretty
  formatting aspects. For types with explicit inserters (real, int, etc.)
  it seems I can use the width and fmt parameters to log prettily, but its
  unclear how to space strings.
  
  For example how should I translate:

    printf("Name: %40s", name.c_str()); 
  
  "   [24th June 2009]

A17:
  As of 1.0.1 beta 189, the padding inserter pantheios::pad() can be used
  to provide a string of spaces of the necessary size to pad a variable of
  arbitrary type, as in:
  
    #include <pantheios/inserters/pad.hpp>          // for pantheios::pad


    printf("Name: %40s.\n", name.c_str()); 

    pantheios::log_NOTICE("Name: ", PANTHEIOS_LPAD(name, 40), ".");

  The inserter is used via the PANTHEIOS_LPAD(), which inserts pad spaces
  to the left of the variable, and PANTHEIOS_RPAD(), which inserts pad
  spaces to the right.


Q18: "I've written a custom front-end to work with be.N, but the backendId
  is always 0 in pantheios_fe_isSeverityLogged(), and nothing gets logged!"

A18:
  pantheios_fe_isSeverityLogged() is always called first by the Application
  Layer, to determine whether a log statement at the given severity level
  will be logged; If not, nothing needs to be converted. In this invocation
  the backendId parameter will be 0 (aka PANTHEIOS_BEID_ALL), meaning "does
  anything need to be logged?"

  Multiplexing back-ends (e.g. be.N) also call pantheios_fe_isSeverityLogged()
  to determine whether a specific back-end is interested in the given log
  statement (based on its severity level).
  
  So, if you are writing a custom front-end, you must handle both cases: 0
  for "any back-ends?", and specific non-0 values (your specific back-end
  identifiers) representing your specific back-ends. The scratch test
  program test.scratch.be.N.with.custom.fe illustrates how this is to done.
  Its definition of pantheios_fe_isSeverityLogged() is as follows:

  PANTHEIOS_CALL(int) pantheios_fe_isSeverityLogged(void*, int severity, int beid)
  {
    switch(beid)
    {
      // Must handle PANTHEIOS_BEID_ALL, as that's the Application Layer's
      // (initial) enquiry as to whether anything should be logged at all
      case  PANTHEIOS_BEID_ALL: 
  #if 0
        // The inefficient way to do this is to just 'return true'
        return true;
  #else /* ? 0 */
        // The efficient (but complicated) way to do this is to see if
        // *any* back-end wants output, in which case we say yes
        return  severity <= iCeilingMain || 
            severity <= iCeilingConsole ||
            severity <= iCeilingError;
  #endif /* 0 */

      // Now handle each specified back-end, which will come from be.N
      // multiplexing the output(s)

      case  WG_LOG_FILE_ID:
        return severity <= iCeilingMain;
      case  WG_LOG_CONSOLE_ID:
        return severity <= iCeilingConsole;
      case  WG_LOG_FILE_ERROR_ID:
        return severity <= iCeilingError;

      // Don't know about anything else
      default:
        PANTHEIOS_CONTRACT_ENFORCE_UNEXPECTED_CONDITION_API("unexpected back-end identifier");
        return false;
    }
  }


Q19: "My project requires that I use Microsoft Visual C++'s /Zc:wchar_t-
     option, which prevents wchar_t from being a built-in type, instead
     being just a typedef to 'unsigned short'. When I try to link with
     Pantheios I get link errors, such as:

        1>Zc.wchar_t.test.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol "public: __thiscall pantheios::args::args(int,unsigned short const * const *,int,unsigned short const *)" (??0args@pantheios@@QAE@HPBQBGHPBG@Z) referenced in function _wmain
        1>Zc.wchar_t.test.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol "public: unsigned short const * __thiscall pantheios::args::data(void)const " (?data@args@pantheios@@QBEPBGXZ) referenced in function "unsigned short const * __cdecl pantheios::shims::c_str_data_w(class pantheios::args const &)" (?c_str_data_w@shims@pantheios@@YAPBGABVargs@2@@Z)
        1>Zc.wchar_t.test.obj : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol "public: unsigned short const * __thiscall pantheios::integer::data(void)const " (?data@integer@pantheios@@QBEPBGXZ) referenced in function "unsigned short const * __cdecl pantheios::shims::c_str_data_w(class pantheios::integer const &)" (?c_str_data_w@shims@pantheios@@YAPBGABVinteger@2@@Z)

     How can I get Pantheios to define wchar_t in the same way without
     hacking the makefile?
     "

A19:
  You have to link against a version of Pantheios compiled with the same
  compiler flag. This can be achieved by setting the CUSTOM_DEFS make macro
  as follows:

    > nmake CUSTOM_DEFS="-Zc:wchar_t-" build

  You will then be able to link to your program.

  NOTE: You will need to ensure that other code that relies on Pantheios and
  that was not compiled with -Zc:wchar_t- will see another, uncustomised,
  version, otherwise you'll have the same linking problem, but in reverse.
