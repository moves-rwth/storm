This directory contains a nixpkgs overlay that defines the necessary build
scripts to build storm and its dependencies.

To use it, do one of the following:
 1. Link ./default.nix to ~/.config/nixpkgs/overlays/<some-name>
 2. Add its full path to the environment variable NIX_PATH, i.e.:
    NIX_PATH=${NIX_PATH}:nixpkgs-overlays=$PWD/default.nix

See also https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/manual/#chap-overlays for further
information.

To build storm from the current branch call:
   nix-build '<nixpkgs>' -A stormChecker

The attribute stormChecker builds storm with minimal options, stormCheckerFull
activates all bells and whistles. See ./default.nix to change build options like
LTO support, Z3 and others.

See ./storm/default.nix on how to specify a specific Git commit to build storm
from.
