# While running some benchmark, Tomáš Babiak found that Spot took too
# much time (i.e. >1h) to translate those six formulae.  It turns out
# that the WDBA minimization was performed after the degeneralization
# algorithm, while this is not necessary (WDBA will produce a BA, so
# we may as well skip degeneralization).  Translating these formulae
# in the test-suite ensure that they don't take too much time (the
# buildfarm will timeout if it does).
