# This bug was found while working on the state-based acceptance
# output for the LBTT format.  Using ba-simul=2 causes reverse
# simulation to be applied to the BA automaton obtained after
# degeneralization.  Unfortunately in Spot 1.1, reverse simulation is
# only implemented on TGBA, and when applied to a TGBA that is a BA,
# it may merge one state that is accepting with one state that is not
# accepting, just because they have the same incoming transitions.
# (Applying direct simulation on a TGBA that is a BA is not a problem,
# since an accepting state will never have the same outgoing
# transitions as a BA.)

# In previous tests, we did not notice the bug because the --lbtt
# output was always using transition-based acceptance (the equivalent
# of --lbtt=t today), so the result of the reverse-simulation on the
# BA was output as a TGBA with a single acceptance set, and some state
# had both accepting and non-accepting transitions because of the
# merge.  Unfortunately, this is not a Büchi automaton.  Using the
# --spin output, or the new (state-based) --lbtt output highlights the
# bug.

# In the cases below, the following configurations used to fail
# cross-comparison with the other "sane" configurations, at least
# with the first formula.  (The other three formulas were added because
# they also triggered related issues while debugging the first one.)
#    --lbtt -x ba-simul=2
#    --lbtt -x ba-simul=3
#    --spin -x ba-simul=2
#    --spin -x ba-simul=3
