<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Common
fine-tuning options for binaries built with Spot.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The argument of
<b>-x</b> or <b>--extra-options</b> is a comma-separated
list of KEY=INT assignments that are passed to the
post-processing routines (they may be passed to other
algorithms in the future). These options are mostly used for
benchmarking and debugging purpose. KEYR (without any value)
is a shorthand for KEY=1, while !KEY is a shorthand for
KEY=0.</p>

<h3 style="margin-left:11%">Temporal
logic simplification options:</h3><p style="margin-left:11%">
tls-impl</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Control usage of
implication-based rewriting. (0) disables it, (1) enables
rules based on syntactic implications, (2) additionally
allows automata-based implication checks, (3) enables more
rules based on automata-based implication checks. The
default value depends on the <b>--low</b>, <b>--medium</b>,
or <b>--high</b> settings.</p>

<h3 style="margin-left:11%">Translation
options:</h3><p style="margin-left:11%">
comp-susp</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set to 1 to enable
compositional suspension, as described in our SPIN&rsquo;13
paper (see Bibliography below). Set to 2, to build only the
skeleton TGBA without composing it. Set to 0 (the default)
to disable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">early-susp</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When set to 1, start
compositional suspension on the transitions that enter
accepting SCCs, and not only on the transitions inside
accepting SCCs. This option defaults to 0, and is only used
when comp-susp=1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">ltl-split</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set to 0 to disable the
translation of automata as product or sum of
subformulas.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">skel-simul</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Default to 1. Set to 0 to
disable simulation on the skeleton automaton during
compositional suspension. Only used when comp-susp=1.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">skel-wdba</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set to 0 to disable WDBA
minimization on the skeleton automaton during compositional
suspension. Set to 1 always WDBA-minimize the skeleton . Set
to 2 to keep the WDBA only if it is smaller than the
original skeleton. This option is only used when comp-susp=1
and default to 1 or 2 depending on whether <b>--small</b> or
<b>--deterministic</b> is specified.</p>


<h3 style="margin-left:11%">Postprocessing
options:</h3><p style="margin-left:11%">
ba-simul</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set to 0 to disable
simulation-based reductions on automata where state-based
acceptance must be preserved (e.g., after degeneralization
has been performed). The name suggests this applies only to
B&uuml;chi automata for historical reasons; it really
applies to any state-based acceptance nowadays. Set to 1 to
use only direct simulation. Set to 2 to use only reverse
simulation. Set to 3 to iterate both direct and reverse
simulations. The default is 3 in <b>--high</b> mode, and 0
otherwise.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">degen-lcache</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If non-zero (the default is 1),
whenever the degeneralization algorithm enters an SCC on a
state that has already been associated to a level elsewhere,
it should reuse that level. Different values can be used to
select which level to reuse: 1 always uses the first level
created, 2 uses the minimum level seen so far, and 3 uses
the maximum level seen so far. The &quot;lcache&quot; stands
for &quot;level cache&quot;.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">degen-lowinit</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Whenever the degeneralization
algorihm enters a new SCC (or starts from the initial
state), it starts on some level L that is compatible with
all outgoing transitions. If degen-lowinit is zero (the
default) and the corresponding state (in the generalized
automaton) has an accepting self-loop, then level L is
replaced by the accepting level, as it might favor finding
accepting cycles earlier. If degen-lowinit is non-zero, then
level L is always used without looking for the presence of
an accepting self-loop.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">degen-lskip</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If non-zero (the default), the
degeneralization algorithm will skip as much levels as
possible for each transition. This is enabled by default as
it very often reduce the number of resulting states. A
consequence of skipping levels is that the degeneralized
automaton tends to have smaller cycles around the accepting
states. Disabling skipping will produce automata with large
cycles, and often with more states.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">degen-order</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If non-zero, the
degeneralization algorithm will compute an independent
degeneralization order for each SCC it processes. This is
currently disabled by default.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">degen-remscc</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If non-zero (the default), make
sure the output of the degenalization has as many SCCs as
the input, by removing superfluous ones.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">degen-reset</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If non-zero (the default), the
degeneralization algorithm will reset its level any time it
exits an SCC.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">det-max-edges</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When defined to a positive
integer N, determinizations will be aborted whenever the
number of generated edges would exceed N. In this case a
non-deterministic automaton will be returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">det-max-states</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When defined to a positive
integer N, determinizations will be aborted whenever the
number of generated states would exceed N. In this case a
non-deterministic automaton will be returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">det-scc</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set to 0 to disable scc-based
optimizations in the determinization algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">det-simul</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set to 0 to disable
simulation-based optimizations in the determinization
algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">det-stutter</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set to 0 to disable
optimizations based on the stutter-invariance in the
determinization algorithm.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">gen-reduce-parity</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When the postprocessor routines
are configured to output automata with any kind of
acceptance condition, but they happen to process an
automaton with parity acceptance, they call a function to
minimize the number of colors needed. This option controls
what happen when this reduction does not reduce the number
of colors: when set (the default) the output of the
reduction is returned, this means the colors in the
automaton may have changed slightly, and in particular,
there is no transition with more than one color; when unset,
the original automaton is returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">gf-guarantee</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set to 0 to disable alternate
constructions for GF(guarantee)-&gt;[D]BA and
FG(safety)-&gt;DCA. Those constructions are from an
LICS&rsquo;18 paper by J. Esparza, J.
K&#345;ent&iacute;nsk&yacute;, and S. Sickert. This is
enabled by default for medium and high optimization levels.
Unless we are building deterministic automata, the resulting
automata are compared to the automata built using the more
traditional pipeline, and only kept if they are better.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">relabel-bool</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If set to a positive integer N,
a formula with N atomic propositions or more will have its
Boolean subformulas abstracted as atomic propositions during
the translation to automaton. This relabeling can speeds the
translation if a few Boolean subformulas use a large number
of atomic propositions. By default N=4. Setting this value
to 0 will disable the rewriting.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">sat-acc</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When this is set to some
positive integer, the SAT-based will attempt to construct a
TGBA with the given number of acceptance sets. states. It
may however return an automaton with less acceptance sets if
some of these are useless. Setting sat-acc automatically
sets sat-minimize to 1 if not set differently.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">sat-incr-steps</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set the value of
sat-incr-steps. This variable is used by two SAT-based
minimization algorithms: (2) and (3). They are both
described below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">sat-langmap</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Find the lower bound of default
sat-minimize procedure (1). This relies on the fact that the
size of the minimal automaton is at least equal to the total
number of different languages recognized by the
automaton&rsquo;s states.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">sat-minimize</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set it to enable SAT-based
minimization of deterministic TGBA. Depending on its value
(from 1 to 4) it changes the algorithm to perform. The
default value is (1) and it proves to be the most effective
method. SAT-based minimization uses PicoSAT (distributed
with Spot), but another installed SAT-solver can be set
thanks to the SPOT_SATSOLVER environment variable. Enabling
SAT-based minimization will also enable tba-det.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">sat-states</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When this is set to some
positive integer, the SAT-based minimization will attempt to
construct a TGBA with the given number of states. It may
however return an automaton with less states if some of
these are unreachable or useless. Setting sat-states
automatically enables sat-minimize, but no iteration is
performed. If no equivalent automaton could be constructed
with the given number of states, the original automaton is
returned.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">scc-filter</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set to 1 (the default) to
enable SCC-pruning and acceptance simplification at the
beginning of post-processing. Transitions that are outside
of accepting SCC are removed from accepting sets, except
those that enter into an accepting SCC. Set to 2 to remove
even these entering transition from the accepting sets. Set
to 0 to disable this SCC-pruning and acceptance
simpification pass.</p>

<b>--low</b> is specified, in which case the default is
1.</p> </td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">state-based</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set to 1 to instruct the
SAT-minimization procedure to produce a TGBA where all
outgoing transition of a state have the same acceptance
sets. By default this is only enabled when option <b>-B</b>
is used.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">tba-det</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set to 1 to attempt a powerset
determinization if the TGBA is not already deterministic.
Doing so will degeneralize the automaton. This is disabled
by default, unless sat-minimize is set.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">wdba-minimize</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set to 0 to disable
WDBA-minimization, to 1 to always try it, or 2 to attempt it
only on syntactic obligations or on automata that are weak
and deterministic. The default is 1 in <b>--high</b> mode,
else 2 in <b>--medium</b> or <b>--deterministic</b> modes,
else 0 in <b>--low</b> mode.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>SPOT_BDD_TRACE</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If this variable is set to any
value, statistics about BDD garbage collection and resizing
will be output on standard error.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SPOT_DEFAULT_FORMAT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Set to a value of <b>dot</b> or
<b>hoa</b> to override the default format used to output
automata. Up to Spot 1.9.6 the default output format for
automata used to be <b>dot</b>. Starting with Spot 1.9.7,
the default output format switched to <b>hoa</b> as it is
more convenient when chaining tools in a pipe. Set this
variable to <b>dot</b> to get the old behavior. Additional
options may be passed to the printer by suffixing the output
format with <b>=</b> and the options. For instance
running</p>

<p style="margin-left:28%;">% SPOT_DEFAULT_FORMAT=dot=bar
autfilt ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">is the same as running</p>

<p style="margin-left:28%;">% autfilt --dot=bar ...</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">but the use of the environment
variable makes more sense if you set it up once for many
commands.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SPOT_DEBUG_PARSER</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If this variable is set to any
value, the automaton parser of Spot is executed in debug
mode, showing how the input is processed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SPOT_DOTDEFAULT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Whenever the --dot option is
used without argument (even implicitely via
<b>SPOT_DEFAULT_FORMAT</b>), the contents of this variable
is used as default argument. If you have some default
settings in <b>SPOT_DOTDEFAULT</b> and want to append to
options xyz temporarily for one call, use --dot=.xyz: the
dot character will be replaced by the contents of the
SPOT_DOTDEFAULT environment variable.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SPOT_DOTEXTRA</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The contents of this variable
is added to any dot output, immediately before the first
state is output. This makes it easy to override global
attributes of the graph.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SPOT_HOA_TOLERANT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If this variable is set, a few
sanity checks performed by the HOA parser are skipped. The
tests in questions correspond to issues in third-party tools
that output incorrect HOA (e.g., declaring the automaton
with property &quot;univ-branch&quot; when no universal
branching is actually used)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SPOT_O_CHECK</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SPOT_OOM_ABORT</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If this variable is set,
Out-Of-Memory errors will abort() the program (potentially
generating a coredump) instead of raising an exception. This
is useful to debug a program and to obtain a stack trace
pointing to the function doing the allocation. When this
variable is unset (the default), std::bad_alloc are thrown
on memory allocation failures, and the stack is usually
unwinded up to top-level, losing the original context of the
error. Note that at least ltlcross has some custom handling
of std::bad_alloc to recover from products that are too
large (by ignoring them), and setting this variable will
interfer with that.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SPOT_PR_CHECK</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Select the default algorithm
that must be used to check the persistence or recurrence
property of a formula f. The values it can take are between
1 and 3. All methods work either on f or !f thanks to the
duality of persistence and recurrence classes. See
<a href="https://spot.lrde.epita.fr/hierarchy.html">this

</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SPOT_SATLOG</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If set to a filename, the
SAT-based minimization routines will append statistics about
each iteration to the named file. Each line lists the
following comma-separated values: input number of states,
target number of states, number of reachable states in the
output, number of edges in the output, number of transitions
in the output, number of variables in the SAT problem,
number of clauses in the SAT problem, user time for encoding
the SAT problem, system time for encoding the SAT problem,
user time for solving the SAT problem, system time for
solving the SAT problem, automaton produced at this step in
HOA format.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SPOT_SATSOLVER</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">If set, this variable should
indicate how to call an external SAT-solver - by default,
Spot uses PicoSAT, which is distributed with. This is used
by the sat-minimize option described above. The format to
follow is the following: &quot;&lt;sat_solver&gt; [options]
%I &gt;%O&quot;. The escape sequences %I and %O respectively
denote the names of the input and output files. These
temporary files are created in the directory specified by
<b>SPOT_TMPDIR</b> or <b>TMPDIR</b> (see below). The
SAT-solver should follow the convention of the SAT
Competition for its input and output format.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SPOT_STREETT_CONV_MIN</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">The number of Streett pairs
above which conversion from Streett acceptance to
generalized-B&uuml;chi acceptance should be made with a
dedicated algorithm. By default this is 3, i.e., if a
Streett automaton with 3 acceptance pairs or more has to be
converted into generalized-B&uuml;chi, the dedicated
algorithm is used. This algorithm is close to the classical
conversion from Streett to B&uuml;chi, but with several
tweaks. When this algorithm is not used, the standard
&quot;Fin-removal&quot; approach is used instead: first the
acceptance condition is converted into disjunctive normal
form (DNF), then Fin acceptance is removed like for Rabin
automata, yielding a disjuction of generalized B&uuml;chi
acceptance, and the result is finally converted into
conjunctive normal form (CNF) to obtain a generalized
B&uuml;chi acceptance. Both algorithms have a worst-case
size that is exponential in the number of Streett pairs, but
in practice the dedicated algorithm works better for most
Streett automata with 3 or more pairs (and many 2-pair
Streett automata as well, but the difference here is less
clear). Setting this variable to 0 will disable the
dedicated algorithm. Setting it to 1 will enable it for all
Streett automata, however we do not recommand setting it to
less than 2, because the &quot;Fin-removal&quot; approach is
better for single-pair Streett automata.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SPOT_STUTTER_CHECK</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Select the default check used
to decide stutter invariance. The variable should hold a
value between 1 and 8, corresponding to the following tests
described in our Spin&rsquo;15 paper (see the BIBLIOGRAPHY
section). The default is 8.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">This variable is used by the
<b>--check=stutter-invariance</b> and
<b>--stutter-invariant</b> options, but it is ignored by
<b>--check=stutter-sensitive-example</b>. <b><br>
SPOT_TMPDIR</b>, <b><br>
TMPDIR</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">These variables control in
which directory temporary files (e.g., those who contain the
input and output when interfacing with translators) are
created. <b>TMPDIR</b> is only read if <b>SPOT_TMPDIR</b>
does not exist. If none of these environment variables
exist, or if their value is empty, files are created in the
current directory.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SPOT_TMPKEEP</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">When this variable is defined,
temporary files are not removed. This is mostly useful for
debugging.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;"><b>SPOT_XCNF</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%;">Assign a folder path to this
variable to generate XCNF files whenever SAT-based
minimization is used - the file is outputed as
&quot;incr.xcnf&quot; in the specified directory. This
feature works only with an external SAT-solver. See
<b>SPOT_SATSOLVER</b> to know how to provide one. Also note
that this needs an incremental approach without restarting
the encoding i.e &quot;sat-minimize=3,param=-1&quot; for
ltl2tgba and ltl2tgta or &quot;incr,param=-1&quot; for
autfilt (see sat-minimize options described above or autfilt
man page). The XCNF format is the one used by the SAT
incremental competition.</p>
