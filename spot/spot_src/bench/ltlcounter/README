In the following paper by Rozier & Vardi, a class of LTL formula
describing counters was used to stress many translators.

  author	= {Kristin Y. Rozier and Moshe Y. Vardi},
  title		= {LTL Satisfiability Checking},

		  Model Checking of Software (SPIN'07)},

For a description of these formulae, you may also see

This benchmark used this family of formulae to plot the performance
of the ltl2tgba_fm algorithm.  Studying the behaviour of ltl2tgba_fm
on this class of formulae helped us to improve the translation.

Execute "./run" to compute the raw numbers, then execute
"gnuplot plot.gnu" to plot the figures.
