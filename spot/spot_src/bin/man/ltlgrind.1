.SH NAME
ltlgrind \- list mutations of a formula.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ltlgrind
[\fI\,OPTION\/\fR...] [\fI\,FILENAME\/\fR[\fI\,/COL\/\fR]...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
List formulas that are similar to but simpler than a given formula.
.SS "Input options:"
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-formula\fR=\fI\,STRING\/\fR
process the formula STRING
.TP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-file\fR=\fI\,FILENAME\/\fR[\fI\,/COL\/\fR]\fI\,\/\fR
process each line of FILENAME as a formula; if COL
is a positive integer, assume a CSV file and read
column COL; use a negative COL to drop the first
line of the CSV file
.TP
\fB\-\-lbt\-input\fR
read all formulas using LBT's prefix syntax
.TP
\fB\-\-lenient\fR
parenthesized blocks that cannot be parsed as
subformulas are considered as atomic properties
.SS "Mutation rules (all enabled unless those options are used):"
.TP
\fB\-\-ap\-to\-const\fR
atomic propositions are replaced with true/false
.TP
\fB\-\-remove\-multop\-operands\fR
remove one operand from multops
.TP
\fB\-\-remove\-one\-ap\fR
all occurrences of an atomic proposition are
replaced with another atomic proposition used in
the formula
.TP
\fB\-\-remove\-ops\fR
replace unary/binary operators with one of their
operands
.TP
\fB\-\-rewrite\-ops\fR
rewrite operators that have a semantically simpler
form: a U b becomes a W b, etc.
.TP
\fB\-\-simplify\-bounds\fR
on a bounded unary operator, decrement one of the
bounds, or set min to 0 or max to unbounded
.TP
\fB\-\-split\-ops\fR
when an operator can be expressed as a
conjunction/disjunction using simpler operators,
each term of the conjunction/disjunction is a
mutation. e.g. a <\-> b can be written as ((a & b)
| (!a & !b)) or as ((a \-> b) & (b \-> a)) so those
four terms can be a mutation of a <\-> b
.SS "Output options:"
.TP
\fB\-0\fR, \fB\-\-zero\-terminated\-output\fR
separate output formulas with \e0 instead of \en
(for use with xargs \fB\-0\fR)
.TP
\fB\-8\fR, \fB\-\-utf8\fR
output using UTF\-8 characters
.TP
\fB\-\-format\fR=\fI\,FORMAT\/\fR, \fB\-\-stats\fR=\fI\,FORMAT\/\fR
specify how each line should be output (default:
"%f")
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-lbt\fR
output in LBT's syntax
.TP
\fB\-\-latex\fR
output using LaTeX macros
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-mutations\fR=\fI\,NUM\/\fR
number of mutations to apply to the formulae
(default: 1)
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-max\-count\fR=\fI\,NUM\/\fR
maximum number of mutations to output
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\fR=\fI\,FORMAT\/\fR
send output to a file named FORMAT instead of
standard output.  The first formula sent to a file
truncates it unless FORMAT starts with '>>'.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-full\-parentheses\fR
output fully\-parenthesized formulas
.TP
\fB\-\-sort\fR
sort the result by formula size
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-spin\fR
output in Spin's syntax
.TP
\fB\-\-spot\fR
output in Spot's syntax (default)
.TP
\fB\-\-wring\fR
output in Wring's syntax
.PP
The FORMAT string passed to \fB\-\-format\fR may use the following interpreted
sequences:
.TP
%<
the part of the line before the formula if it
comes from a column extracted from a CSV file
.TP
%>
the part of the line after the formula if it comes
from a column extracted from a CSV file
.TP
%%
a single %
.TP
%b
the Boolean\-length of the formula (i.e., all
Boolean subformulas count as 1)
.TP
%f
the formula (in the selected syntax)
.TP
%F
the name of the input file
.TP
%h, %[vw]h
the class of the formula is the Manna\-Pnueli
hierarchy ([v] replaces abbreviations by class
names, [w] for all compatible classes)
.TP
%L
the original line number in the input file
.TP
%[OP]n
the nesting depth of operator OP.  OP should be a
single letter denoting the operator to count, or
multiple letters to fuse several operators during
depth evaluation.  Add '~' to rewrite the formula
in negative normal form before counting.
.TP
%s
the length (or size) of the formula
.TP
%x, %[LETTERS]X, %[LETTERS]x
number of atomic propositions used in the
.TP
formula;
add LETTERS to list atomic propositions
.TP
with (n) no quoting, (s) occasional double\-quotes
with C\-style escape, (d) double\-quotes with
C\-style escape, (c) double\-quotes with CSV\-style
escape, (p) between parentheses, any extra
non\-alphanumeric character will be used to
separate propositions
.SS "Miscellaneous options:"
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
print this help
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
print program version
.PP
Mandatory or optional arguments to long options are also mandatory or optional
for any corresponding short options.
