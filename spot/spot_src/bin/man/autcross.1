.SH NAME
autcross \- cross-compare tools that process automata
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B autcross
[\fI\,OPTION\/\fR...] [\fI\,COMMANDFMT\/\fR...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Call several tools that process automata and cross\-compare their output to
detect bugs, or to gather statistics.  The list of automata to use should be
supplied on standard input, or using the \fB\-F\fR option.
.SS "Input:"
.TP
\fB\-F\fR, \fB\-\-file\fR=\fI\,FILENAME\/\fR
process automata from FILENAME
.SS "Specifying tools to call:"
.TP
\fB\-\-list\-shorthands\fR
list availabled shorthands to use in COMMANDFMT
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-tool\fR=\fI\,COMMANDFMT\/\fR
register one tool to call
.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-timeout\fR=\fI\,NUMBER\/\fR
kill tools after NUMBER seconds
.PP
COMMANDFMT should specify input and output arguments using the following
character sequences:
.TP
%%
a single %
.TP
%H,%S,%L
filename for the input automaton in (H) HOA, (S)
Spin's neverclaim, or (L) LBTT's format
.TP
%M, %[val]M
the name of the input automaton, with an optional
default value
.TP
%O
filename for the automaton output in HOA, never
claim, LBTT, or ltl2dstar's format
.SS "Parsing of automata:"
.TP
\fB\-\-trust\-hoa\fR=\fI\,BOOL\/\fR
If false, properties listed in HOA files are
ignored, unless they can be easily verified.  If
true (the default) any supported property is
trusted.
.SS "autcross behavior:"
.TP
\fB\-\-fail\-on\-timeout\fR
consider timeouts as errors
.TP
\fB\-\-ignore\-execution\-failures\fR
ignore automata from translators that return with
a non\-zero exit code, but do not flag this as an
error
.TP
\fB\-\-language\-preserved\fR
expect that each tool preserves the input
language
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-checks\fR
do not perform any sanity checks
.TP
\fB\-\-stop\-on\-error\fR
stop on first execution error or failure to pass
sanity checks (timeouts are OK)
.SS "Statistics output:"
.TP
\fB\-\-csv\fR[\fI\,\/\fR=\fI\,\/\fR[\fI\,\/\fR>>]FILENAME]
output statistics as CSV in FILENAME or on
standard output (if '>>' is used to request append
mode, the header line is not output)
.TP
\fB\-\-omit\-missing\fR
do not output statistics for timeouts or failed
translations
.SS "Simplification level (for complementation):"
.TP
\fB\-\-high\fR
all available optimizations (slow, default)
.TP
\fB\-\-low\fR
minimal optimizations (fast)
.TP
\fB\-\-medium\fR
moderate optimizations
.SS "Output options:"
.TP
\fB\-\-color\fR[=\fI\,WHEN\/\fR]
colorize output; WHEN can be 'never', 'always'
(the default if \fB\-\-color\fR is used without argument),
or 'auto' (the default if \fB\-\-color\fR is not used)
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
suppress all normal output in absence of errors
.TP
\fB\-\-save\-bogus\fR=\fI\,\/\fR[\fI\,\/\fR>>]FILENAME
save automata for which problems were
detected in FILENAME
.TP
\fB\-\-verbose\fR
print what is being done, for debugging
.PP
If an output FILENAME is prefixed with '>>', it is open in append mode instead
of being truncated.
.SS "Miscellaneous options:"
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
print this help
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
print program version
.PP
Mandatory or optional arguments to long options are also mandatory or optional
for any corresponding short options.
.SS "Exit status:"
.TP
0
everything went fine (without \fB\-\-fail\-on\-timeout\fR, timeouts are OK)
.TP
1
some tools failed to output something we understand, or failed
sanity checks (statistics were output nonetheless)
.TP
2
autcross aborted on error
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.TP
\fBSPOT_TMPDIR\fR, \fBTMPDIR\fR
These variables control in which directory temporary files (e.g.,
those who contain the input and output when interfacing with
translators) are created.  \fBTMPDIR\fR is only read if
\fBSPOT_TMPDIR\fR does not exist.  If none of these environment
variables exist, or if their value is empty, files are created in the
current directory.
.TP
\fBSPOT_TMPKEEP\fR
When this variable is defined, temporary files are not removed.
This is mostly useful for debugging.
.SH "OUTPUT DATA"
The following columns are output in the CSV files.
.TP
\fBinput.source\fR
Location of the input automaton fed to the tool.
.TP
\fBinput.name\fR
Name of the input automaton, if any.  This is supported
by the HOA format.
.TP
\fBinput.ap\fR,\fBoutput.ap\fR,
Number of atomic proposition in the input and output automata.
.TP
\fBinput.states\fR,\fBoutput.states\fR
Number of states in the input and output automata.
.TP
\fBinput.edges\fR,\fBoutput.edges\fR
Number of edges in the input and output automata.
.TP
\fBinput.transitions\fR,\fBoutput.transitions\fR
Number of transitions in the input and output automata.
.TP
\fBinput.acc_sets\fR,\fBoutput.acc_sets\fR
Number of acceptance sets in the input and output automata.
.TP
\fBinput.scc\fR,\fBoutput.scc\fR
Number of strongly connected components in the input and output automata.
.TP
\fBinput.nondetstates\fR,\fBoutput.nondetstates\fR
Number of nondeterministic states in the input and output automata.
.TP
\fBinput.nondeterministic\fR,\fBoutput.nondetstates\fR
1 if the automaton is nondeterministic, 0 if it is deterministic.
.TP
\fBinput.alternating\fR,\fBoutput.alternating\fR
1 if the automaton has some universal branching, 0 otherwise.

\fBexit_status\fR, \fBexit_code\fR
Information about how the execution of the tool went.
\fBexit_status\fR is a string that can take the following
values:
.RS
.TP
\f(CW"ok"\fR
The tool ran succesfully (this does not imply that the produced
automaton is correct) and autcross could parse the resulting
automaton.  In this case \fBexit_code\fR is always 0.
.TP
\f(CW"timeout"\fR
The tool ran for more than the number of seconds
specified with the \fB\-\-timeout\fR option.  In this
case \fBexit_code\fR is always -1.
.TP
\f(CW"exit code"\fR
The tool terminated with a non-zero exit code.
\fBexit_code\fR contains that value.
.TP
\f(CW"signal"\fR
The tool terminated with a signal.
\fBexit_code\fR contains that signal's number.
.TP
\f(CW"parse error"\fR
The tool terminated normally, but autcross could not
parse its output.  In this case \fBexit_code\fR is always -1.
.TP
\f(CW"no output"\fR
The tool terminated normally, but without creating the specified
output file.  In this case \fBexit_code\fR is always -1.
.RE
.TP
\fBtime\fR
A floating point number giving the run time of the tool in seconds.
This is reported for all executions, even failling ones.
