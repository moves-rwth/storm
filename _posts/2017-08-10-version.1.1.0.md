As Storm has quite some new features and its dependencies (noticably, carl) moved forward as well, we are happy to announce Storm version 1.1.0.
<!--more-->

New features are, among others, long run average computation via value iteration, and improvements for handling parametric Markov chains. We also invested a lot in better error messages!
For more information, please check the [release notes](https://github.com/moves-rwth/storm/releases/tag/1.1.0).

We also updated the Homebrew formula, so users who installed storm via homebrew are able to update Storm by

```console
$ brew update
$ brew upgrade stormchecker
```
