We are delighted that a tool-paper describing Storm has been accepted for presentation at [Computer Aided Verification 2017](http://cavconference.org/2017/accepted-papers/) in Heidelberg, Germany.

The short paper gives an overview of the main features of Storm.

We are furthermore very happy to announce that a second paper describing multi-objective model checking for Markov automata has been accepted as well.
The updated documentation now contains [an example]({{ site.baseurl}}/documentation/usage/running-storm.html#multi-objective-model-checking-of-a-markov-automaton) describing how to use the new multi-objective features on Markov automata.
