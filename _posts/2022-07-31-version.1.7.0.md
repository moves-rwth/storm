We are happy to announce the next stable releases of Storm and stormpy in version 1.7.0.
<!--more-->

The new release of Storm is now built in C++17 mode and supports step-bounded until formulas in LTL and lexicographic multi-objective model checking.
In addition, the DRN parser is more robust now.
The DFT analysis in `storm::dft` added support for additional BE failure distributions such as Weibull and log-normal.

The Python bindings [stormpy](https://moves-rwth.github.io/stormpy/) are also released in a new version which is compatible with the new Storm release.
Stormpy now supports GSPNs, in particular building, parsing and exploring them.
In addition, the new release offers bindings for building the transition matrix and state valuations.

For detailed information on all the changes, please check the [release notes of Storm](https://github.com/moves-rwth/storm/releases/tag/1.7.0) and the [release notes of stormpy](https://github.com/moves-rwth/stormpy/releases/tag/1.7.0).
