We are happy to announce the next stable release of Storm in version 1.2.0.
<!--more-->

New features are, among others, Symbolic (MT/BDD) bisimulation, sound (interval) value iteration and support for multi-objective multi-dimensional reward bounded reachability properties for MDPs.
For more information, please check the [release notes](https://github.com/moves-rwth/storm/releases/tag/1.2.0).

We also updated the Homebrew formula, so users who installed Storm via homebrew are able to update Storm by

```console
$ brew update
$ brew upgrade stormchecker
```

Moreover the python bindings [stormpy](https://moves-rwth.github.io/stormpy/) are now also released in version [1.2.0](https://github.com/moves-rwth/stormpy/releases/tag/1.2.0).

If you experience any bugs, please [let us know]({{ site.github.url }}/documentation/obtain-storm/troubleshooting.html#file-an-issue).
