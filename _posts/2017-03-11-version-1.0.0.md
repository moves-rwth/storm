As Storm is becoming more stable, we decided to take a leap and move Storm's version to 1.0.0.
<!--more-->

Following some bug fixes and other minor improvements, we decided Storm is ready to be published in a version that reflects its maturity.
You can find v1.0.0 on [GitHub](https://github.com/moves-rwth/storm/releases/tag/1.0.0).


We also updated the Homebrew formula, so users of Homebrew are able to update Storm by

```console
$ brew update
$ brew upgrade stormchecker
```
