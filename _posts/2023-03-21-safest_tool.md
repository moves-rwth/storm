The [SAFEST tool](https://www.safest.dgbtek.com) for modeling and analysing static and dynamic fault trees has been released.
SAFEST is based on the Storm model checker.

<!--more-->

The SAFEST tool is based on the DFT analysis approaches implemented in the `storm-dft` library of Storm.
The tool is a joint effort of the [MOVES research group](https://moves.rwth-aachen.de) at RWTH Aachen University, the [FMT group](https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/fmt) at University of Twente and [DGB Technologies](https://www.dgbtek.com).

SAFEST provides a web-based graphical user interface for creating, editing, simplifying and simulating dynamic fault trees.
The fault trees can be analysed with respect to a broad range of metrics using state-of-the-art analysis approaches supported by Storm.

More information on SAFEST is available at [www.safest.dgbtek.com](https://www.safest.dgbtek.com).
