We celebrate the 10th anniversary of Storm.
<!--more-->

On this day, 10 years ago, the [first commit](https://github.com/moves-rwth/storm/commit/9da2eaf3d1c5ec647788c9c341135e99f35c5314) was made to the Storm project.
The project was initially called "MRMC-Cpp" and was aimed to be a reimplementation of the [MRCM modelchecker](http://www.mrmc-tool.org/) in the C++ programming language.
5 years later, in 2017, the Storm model checker was [publicly released]({{ '2017/01/20/release.html' | relative_url }}) for the first time.
Today, Storm is one of the state-of-the-art model checkers for probabilistic systems and continues to receive [active development](https://github.com/moves-rwth/storm/graphs/contributors).
